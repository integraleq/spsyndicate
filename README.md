Jason ~ A JSON Web Framework
============================
Jason is a MTV web framework that accomplishes most of its tasks using JavaScript
Object Notation ([JSON](http://www.json.org/)). Building templates, routing uri
paths to views, configuration management, etc. is all done by defining/using JavaScript object
literals.


Requirements
------------
Jason uses the v8cgi ServerJS definition and its accompanying Apache module.
The framework also relys on Apache's mod_rewrite engine for pretty urls. Because building, 
installing and running v8cgi is too complex to add here, we direct you to the official
[v8cgi homepage](http://code.google.com/p/v8cgi/).


Spsyndicate
-----------
Spsyndicate (Springfield Programming Syndicate) is an open-source software
foundation in Springfield, Missouri, USA. We are always looking for better ways
to do things in technology and software development, and are happy to lead the
way!


Inspirations
------------
The MTV (Model-Template-View) concept is taken from the
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework written in Python. Other
ideas/concepts come from the other v8cgi/MooTools framework,
[Raccoon](http://github.com/keeto/raccoon), and [Express](http://github.com/visionmedia/express).
